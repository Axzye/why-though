L: T-this crate...
K: What about it?
L: We have a long history with this crate.
V: Huh? It's just a normal crate though...
L: The tribulations we had to endure to find this elusive crate. And it's just here. Unmoving.
V: There isn't even anything in it! Ugh.
L: Forget it, you wouldn't know.
V: It's just a crate!!

V: Hey guys, look at this!
V: If you stand right here, you can clip through the ground!
L: Why would we want to do that? We'd just get stuck.
V: Uhh... okay, nevermind.
